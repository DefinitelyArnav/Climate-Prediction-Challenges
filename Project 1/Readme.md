In this project we explored the relationships between different physical variables associated with hurricanes such as the maximum windspeed, minimum wind pressure, PDI, SST, hurrciane clusters from Nakamura et al (2009) and how they relate to the economic loss caused by hurricanes. We also engineer some new features and ultimately build a linear regression to understand feature importance of each variable while predicting the economic loss.
